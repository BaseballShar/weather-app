## What is this ?
This is a website for displaying comprehensive weather information in your location.

Now it has temperature, humidity, rain, wain, wind ... with hourly and daily forecast.

## Why are you building it ?
I wanted to learn and practice more web development skills (especially frontend for now), I went to gather weather information and try to render them nicely for easy viewing.

## It is any useful ?
Yes! Surprisingly. You can use it for current weather report up to a few days in the future. The accuracy is as good as that from the Hong Kong Observatory.

## Any plans for the future ?
Many in fact, that being said, I will list out a few areas for immediate improvement.
- Better direction indicator for wind: Perhaps an animated compass or format using bearing i.e. N35ÂºE
- More language support: Traditional Chinese & Store setting in localStorage
- Light and dark mode
- More weather data types or even astronomical data, for example: Planetary data.

## Technical information
This is written using React and Next.js and hosted by GitHub pages. Tailwind is used to quickly prototype css styles and simplify syntax.
